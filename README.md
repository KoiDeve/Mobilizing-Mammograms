# Mobilizing Mammograms

The inspiration behind our project was to find a way that we could help out the FDA by analyzing locations that would be the most beneficial to allocate the international grant funds towards. We want to make sure that we are noticing the most underrepresented states that lack the necessary resources and training, as well as population migrations patterns in order to target the largest amount of people we can in the future.
